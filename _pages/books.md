Here you can find a list of the (primarily) non-fiction books that I've read. If you're interested in the fiction books I've read, that is a much, much longer list and you should probably friend me on Goodreads. There are a few select fiction books I've included in the list, simply because I think they are very intelligent reads that are relevant to the content on this blog. I have been making an effort recently to read more non-fiction books, and I especially like listening to non-fiction audiobooks. So some of the books on this list I haven't actually read... I've listened to them! With the longer audiobooks, I'll often listen for a bit and then switch to a different book... so some of the books will stay on my "currently reading" list for a while. It just means I'm in the middle of it, and fully intend on finishing it at some point.

## What I'm reading

"Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow" by Yuval Noah Harari
:     I'm listening to this book via Audible. I really enjoyed "Sapiens," and this books builds off of the last chapter in Sapiens to focus on what humanity will look like in the future, but with a reasoning strongly grounded in our history. Fascinating topic by one of my favorite modern philosophers.

"A History of Western Philosophy" by Bertrand Russell
:     I'm listening to this book via Audible... and I kid you not, it is 40 hours long. I'm currently paused somewhere near the beginning of the medieval philosophy section. I can say that the ancient philosophy section was very interesting, and I learned a lot, but I also definitely zoned out while listening to it. Someday I'd like to get a physical copy of this book and use it as a reference (as it's perfectly set up to be just that).

"The Origins of Political Order: From Prehuman Times to the French Revolution" by Francis Fukuyama
:     I'm listening to this book via Audible... and it is also on pause. It has some very interesting theories about how humans were able to form increasingly complex societies, despite being programmed to essentially live in communities no larger than 150 people. It's a study on the theoretical and philosophical foundations of politics, and the first in a duology on Political Order & Political Decay (the second one being on decay).
