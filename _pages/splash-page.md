intro:
  - excerpt: "Follow me as I learn about library science, coding for libraries, data & digital asset management, and more. This blog serves as an archive of my experiences as I complete my MSLIS at UIUC. I write about what I'm learning in class, what I'm doing outside of class, books I'm reading, and random musings about the library world. I will also document my projects, so you can see what I've created and how I did it."
