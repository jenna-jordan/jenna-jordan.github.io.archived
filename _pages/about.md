### Hello!

My name is Jenna Jordan, and I'm a data librarian/steward/engineer (I wear a few hats!). I studied data management & information science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and I graduated with my MS/LIS (Master of Science in Library and Information Science) in May 2020.

On this website, you can find information about the classes I took each semester of my degree ([Fall 2018](/blog/my-classes-for-fall-2018), [Spring 2019](/blog/my-classes-for-spring-2019), [Summer 2019](/blog/my-class-and-internship-for-summer-2019), [Fall 2019](/blog/my-classes-for-fall-2019), [Spring 2020](/blog/my-classes-for-spring-2020)), blog posts about various topics that I'm interested in (such as [the nature of unique identifiers](/blog/defining-unique-identifiers)), and learn about some of the [projects](/projects/) that I have worked on. I am interested primarily in the political science domain, and my projects have focused on improving data resources for researchers in peace/conflict studies (such as the Correlates of War). I had the great fortune of finding the perfect place to practice my data librarian skills within the political science field at the [Cline Center for Advanced Social Research](https://clinecenter.illinois.edu/), where I worked for 3 semesters as a Graduate Research Assistant. For more about my employment history, please [add me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennajordan1) or take a peek at my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZJW9_O73dFAo0ELybxd6rn_ZRnKCIce6/view?usp=sharing).

If you are interested in working with me on a project - or hiring me! - please feel free to send me an email or connect on Twitter or LinkedIn. I'm also happy to talk with any prospective UIUC iSchool students - I had a fantastic experience at the iSchool and would love to spread the word.

## A note about this website

One side benefit of creating & maintaining this blog is that it has helped me learn the basics of building a website. Instead of creating a WordPress blog, filling in the fields and clicking on design options, I chose to create my blog on GitHub Pages, and work with the source files directly. I got a big head start by forking from the Minimal Mistakes theme repo, but every bit of content that I have put onto this blog has been through my own coding/writing in the websites files. You can check out those files at [my website repo on GitHub](https://github.com/jenna-jordan/jenna-jordan.github.io).
