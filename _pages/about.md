### Hello!

My name is Jenna Jordan, and I'm currently studying digital library science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I'm on track to earn my MSLIS (Master of Science in Library and Information Science) by the Spring of 2020, but I have a lot to learn until then!

This blog is a place for me to write about what I'm thinking - whether that's posts synthesizing what I've learned using the Feynman technique, narrative essays about topics that have captured my interests, or tutorials for how to use certain technologies or programs. I also plan to post my projects on here in order to create a portfolio for potential employers or collaborators to view. Hopefully this means that it will be a resource for anybody else who is interested in learning about digital library science, but I am mostly creating this for myself. Writing helps me process, and there is going to be a lot of information for my brain to process!

A side benefit of this blog is that it is also helping me to learn some basics of building a website. Instead of creating a WordPress blog, filling in the fields and clicking on design options, I chose to create my blog on GitHub Pages, and work on the source files directly. I got a big head start by forking from the Minimal Mistakes theme repo, but every bit of content that I have put onto this blog has been through my own coding in the websites files. You can check out those files at [my repo on GitHub](https://github.com/jenna-jordan/jenna-jordan.github.io).
