### Hello!

My name is Jenna Jordan, and I'm currently studying digital library science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I'm on track to earn my MSLIS (Master of Science in Library and Information Science) by the Spring of 2020, but I have a lot to learn until then!

## Why did I create this blog?

This blog is an effort to help me learn in a more meaningful way. There are multiple studies that show you can learn more effectively when you teach others - and there are multiple learning techniques based on this premise of teaching others. One such is the Feynman technique.

> “If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.”

<cite> Attributed to Albert Einstein </cite>

### The Feynman Technique

  1. Write the name of the concept.
  2. Write out an explanation of the concept as if you were explaining it to a layperson (or a child) who has no knowledge of the concept. This will highlight what you understand, but also...
  3. Pinpoint the gaps in your knowledge of the concept. Then go back and reread/relearn it to fill in these gaps. Remember, a child will always ask: _"Why?"_
  4. Repeat steps two and three as many times as necessary.
  5. Edit your explanation, aiming for simplicity over complexity. Use analogies. Use examples. Use illustrations.

## More about me

If you're curious about who I am, what I like, and what I've done, read on!

### What is my academic background?

I earned my Bachelor's degree at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, majoring in both Journalism & Mass Communication and Political Science. I graduated with honors in the Spring of 2015, after completing my honors thesis in Political Science. While I started university interested primarily in journalism and investigative reporting (after spending 3 years working on my high school's newspaper), my focus slowly transitioned over to political science and international relations. I was especially interested in conflict resolution (this may have been influenced by a certain Dr. Elizabeth Weir...) and different types of government (constitutional design... very interesting, very important!). So, I chose to focus my thesis on whether a state's type of government had any effect on its ability to prevent conflict - specifically, civil war recurrence. Working on the thesis was a great (if grueling) experience, because it was the first time I had ever written a full research paper - from developing a theory... to writing a literature review... to gathering the data... to analyzing the data... and finally presenting my findings.

Actually, my experience working on my thesis is a big part of why I decided to go into LIS. I really liked working with the international political data, and I wanted to be able to help other people who may be struggling through the process of trying to conduct research on a topic with vast amounts of data available... but scattered throughout the interwebs.

### What have I been doing since graduation?

Good question. When I graduated, I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do. I had conveniently decided after graduating with a degree in Journalism that I did not want to be a journalist (for various reasons, including my fear of confrontational interactions with strangers). I also wasn't really interested in the types of jobs that poli sci undergrads tend to get straight out of college - I knew that to get a good job I would need a Master's. But what would I get my Master's in? I wasn't sure, and that was a decision that I needed to be sure about. So I did the very typical thing that many 20-somethings do when they don't know what to do with their lives... travel! And what's the best way to travel without going broke? Teach English!

My first stop was in Budapest, Hungary, where I studied how to teach English as a foreign language for one month and earned my CELTA certification. I traveled around Europe for about a month after that (it was my first time!) before heading back to the states to job search. I found a job teaching at a hagwon in South Korea, and spent 15 months teaching English to kindergartners and elementary school students.

While traveling, I considered a lot of different professional paths. I thought about teaching at international schools, going into publishing, even website development. But the path I finally fell in love with was to become a librarian. In Fall of 2017 I applied to my top 3 schools, and also planned for my next adventure. I had 8 months until school started - more time to travel!

So I went back to Europe, and lived as an Au Pair in Spain for 6 months. I also studied Spanish for the first time since elementary school, which was an oddly fascinating process for me from a linguistic perspective (I never had any hope of becoming fluent... but I loved comparing Spanish to English and observing English's romantic roots). I also had the opportunity to take a few trips around Europe - a two-week solo trip around Italy, a one-week solo trip to Porto, Portugal, and a one-week trip with my family to the Netherlands, Switzerland, and France. My favorite trip was definitely Italy... and I fully intend on going back someday. But for now, I'm back in the states, learning how to be a librarian.

### What do I do for fun?

  * Read sci-fi/fantasy books
  * Watch sci-fi/fantasy tv shows
  * Play board games

## In conclusion...

I am mostly going to be using this blog as a tool to help me take notes, organize those notes, and edit those notes according to the Feynman technique. Hopefully this means that it will be a resource for anybody else who is interested in learning about digital library science, but I am mostly creating this for myself. Writing helps me process, and there is going to be a lot of information for my brain to process!

A side benefit of this blog is that it is also helping me to learn some basics of building a website. Instead of creating a WordPress blog, filling in the fields and clicking on design options, I chose to create my blog on GitHub Pages, and work on the source files directly. I got a big head start by forking from the Minimal Mistakes theme repo, but every bit of content that I have put onto this blog has been through my own coding in the websites files. You can check out those files at [my repo on GitHub](https://github.com/jenna-jordan/jenna-jordan.github.io).
