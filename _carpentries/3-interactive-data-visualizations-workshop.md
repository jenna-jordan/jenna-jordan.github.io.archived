I developed this workshop lesson in Summer 2021 as a follow-up to the [Plotting and Programming in Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) lesson. For my personal/work projects, I've been using Streamlit and Plotly to quickly build an online dashboard of interactive data visualizations - and I have 0 web development skills, which really shows the power of Streamlit. So I wanted to teach learners semi-new to Python how to make some data visualization web apps of their own!

This lesson is brand new and has not yet been taught by other instructors (to my knowledge) - so I would really love for other Carpentries Instructors to take it for a spin and let me know how it goes. If you want to know more about the lesson, you can check out the [Incubator Lesson Spotlight post](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/09/incubator-lesson-data-visualization-python/) published on September 9, 2021.

## Lesson Description

This workshop lesson is an introduction to making interactive data visualizations in Python. Learners will create a new environment using conda, wrangle data into the proper format using the pandas library, create visualizations using the Plotly Python library, and display these visualizations and create widgets using Streamlit.
