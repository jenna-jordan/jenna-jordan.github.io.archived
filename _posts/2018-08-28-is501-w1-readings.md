## How to Read for Grad School (Sweeney 2014)

This is just helpful advice for the huge amount of reading that we will have to do for this class.{: .notice--primary}

- Read Strategically, Not Linearly
	- For books: TOC -> Intro -> Conclusion -> Skim (relevant) chapter beg/end, then search middle for evidence
	- For journal articles: Journal name, Article title -> Abstract -> Intro (pay attention to citations) -> Discussion section (sometimes same as conclusion) & conclusion -> Browse methods & results (pay attention to  images/charts, data visualizations)
- Take notes
	- Simultaneously while reading
	- Include detailed citations with page numbers/quotes
	- include questions, observations, provocations for class discussion
- Be purposeful. Ask:
	- What is the author trying to say?
	- What is their motivation?
	- What does the research contribute?
	- What academic conversation is it a part of?
	- What is the main argument?
	- How does it relate to other assigned readings?
- Critical Perspective
	- Who has the power (and who doesn’t)?
	- Who benefits from social arrangements, who is marginalized?
	- What are the underlying values?
	- Who is privileged by these values?
	- How might different values change the argument/conversation?
