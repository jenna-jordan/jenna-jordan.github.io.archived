On Friday, I attended a talk by Dr. Jingrui He about a machine learning solution her team found to the issue of data heterogeneity.

As I have only the basic understanding of machine learning, many of the technical ideas flew right over my head (although I do have to admit that she did an excellent job of explaining the basic concept of how her algorithm worked in a way that I could understand). However, during her talk my brain wandered in a different direction. I may be trying my best to learn as many technical skills as I can during my master's, but at my core I am a humanities person. And so as she was talking about the good her algorithm could do across various industries with heterogeneous data, I was thinking about the ethics behind acquiring that data.

### What is data heterogeneity?

Think about the difference between the biological/chemical terms "homogeneous" and "heterogeneous." "Homo" means the same, and "homogeneous" means having the same (or uniform) makeup (or composition). "Hetero" is the opposite, and means different - so "heterogeneous" means having a non-uniform composition. Heterogeneity is simply referring to something having the quality or characteristic of being diverse. So data heterogeneity, also known as data variety, refers to data that come from many different sources and exists in many different forms. Data Variety is one of the three core "V"s of Big Data.

Let's look at an example: When analyzing someone's health, their medical record is probably a good place to start. But you may also want to look at their activity on health-centered social networking sites, their search history on health-centered websites, and their purchase history at pharmacies. This would give you a much fuller picture of their health. But it also raises an important question - one that was not discussed during her talk. 

How do you acquire all of this data from disparate and (supposedly) protected sources in order to analyze it?

### The Issue of Data Privacy

Right now, there are a number of major new stories in the public consciousness that concern data privacy. Most notably at the moment, the scandal involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica... but this issue has been discussed every since Edward Snowden leaked classified information about the NSA's surveillance policies in 2013.

This is an issue that spans both the public and private realms, with abuses by governments and corporations alike. There are no heroes in this story - or are there?

### Librarians are your data privacy heroes

Who is the one group of people who will fight tooth and nail to both provide you with all of the information and knowledge you may want while simultaneously defending your personal information from anybody who comes knocking? Librarians.

Librarians may technically be (local) government employees, but if the police or the FBI asks a librarian to hand over the reading history of a suspected individual, the librarian will respond, "What reading history?" Libraries deliberately purge their records to protect the privacy of their patrons.

But what does this have to do with the data privacy scandals of the past few years? It means that librarians have an important role to play in this age of big data. 

Libraries are community centers, and beyond that they are a source of continuous, life-long learning. Information literacy is becoming as important for adults as reading literacy is for children.

Librarians are one of the few groups of people that we trust to protect our data and privacy, simply because it is the right thing to do. And I hope that in the public debate surrounding data privacy, librarians will step forward and act as advocates and educators for their communities - informing people about the problem, researching solutions, and advocating for those solutions at the highest levels of government and policy-making.

Keeping this key role of librarians in mind, let's move on to the second part of this article.

## Data Ownership

Let's circle back to the initial thought that inspired this article. How do you get access to all of this heterogeneous data  in order to analyze it?
