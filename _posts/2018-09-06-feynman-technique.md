One of the reasons that I created this blog was in an effort to help me learn in a more meaningful way. There are multiple studies that show you can learn more effectively when you teach others - and there are multiple learning techniques based on this premise of teaching others. One such is the Feynman technique.

### The Feynman Technique

  1. Write the name of the concept.
  2. Write out an explanation of the concept as if you were explaining it to a layperson (or a child) who has no knowledge of the concept. This will highlight what you understand, but also...
  3. Pinpoint the gaps in your knowledge of the concept. Then go back and reread/relearn it to fill in these gaps. Remember, a child will always ask: _"Why?"_
  4. Repeat steps two and three as many times as necessary.
  5. Edit your explanation, aiming for simplicity over complexity. Use analogies. Use examples. Use illustrations.

## Writing about what I'm learning

When I originally created this blog, I figured I would write about every class - which essentially meant copying my notes over and rounding them out. But besides being a huge time-suck, this also didn't really fit with my original goal. It didn't force me to re-conceptualize what I was learning, and present it in a way that anybody could understand. Besides, notes aren't very interesting to read!

So, I decided that I'm not going to write about everything. I'm going to write about the bits that I find interesting, or difficult to understand, or questions that I had and the research I did to find the answers. I'm going to try to refer back to this post and explicitly follow the Feynman Technique, especially when I'm having trouble understanding a key concept. Hopefully this method will be both more useful for me and more interesting for the reader.
