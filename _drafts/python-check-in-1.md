I'm about halfway through my first semester, and I thought I'd do a check-in with how some of my classes are going and what I'm learning. First up: python (or more formally, IS452: Introduction to Information Processing). In the first eight weeks of the class, we have covered basic expressions and loops, the counter and accumulator loop patterns, manipulating lists, functions, reading files, and decision structures. 

Each week follows the same basic pattern:

1. Read the assigned chapters or sections in the Zelle book, and take a short quiz online to check reading comprehension.
2. Attend the lecture, which covers the same material as the reading but in a much more interactive way - lots of pausing for questions and dissecting exactly how the concepts work in python.
3. Do the homework in order to individually practice the concepts learned in lecture and gain experience in actually writing programs from scratch and making sure they work properly. We also write a short reflection on the week to go with the homework problems.

I'm really liking the class so far. I've attempted to learn python in the past (through online tutorials and a night class at a local technical college), but it never really stuck. This time around, however, it is! Maybe it's because I've had previous exposure so it's not completely new to me, maybe it's because of the aforementioned format, maybe because the teacher is really engaging and approaches the material in a non-intimidating way (with lots of room for questions), or maybe it's just because this time I have to learn it in order to get a good grade in the class. Probably a combination of all of those reasons!
