IS501 is a basic intro to library & information science class at UIUC, and one of two required courses for the MSLIS degree (the other being IS502: Libraries, Information, & Society). IS501 focuses on the information itself, on the systems used to organize information, and the lifecycle of information. IS502, on the other hand, focuses more on libraries and issues specific to professional librarians.

This class meets two times a week. The Tuesday class will be one giant class including all of the sections, and the Thursday lab will be a smaller group of about 20 students led by one instructor.

### Course Description

> This course provides an intensive and thorough introduction to fundamentals of information organization and access from the point of view of the field of library and information science. The course is not an introduction to LIS as a whole or to the profession of librarianship--the focus is squarely on information organization and access. 501 aims to acquaint you with the principal problems of information organization and access, the main streams of thought, and the key thinkers and contributors. The material covered is broad in scope and applicable to a wide variety of settings and systems. The course emphasizes the central position of people, communities, and information users in problems of information organization and access.

  * Emphasizes information organization and access in settings and systems of different kinds.
  * Traces the information transfer process from the generation of knowledge through its storage and use in both print and non-print formats.
  * Consideration will be given to the creation of information systems:
    * the principles and practice of selection and preservation,
    * methods of organizing information for retrieval and display,
    * the operation of organizations that provide information services,
    * and the information service needs of various user communities.

### Central Themes

1. Who uses information, how they use it, and what constraints shape their use of information

2. How recorded knowledge can be organized and structuredâ€¨

3. Ways of providing access to the world's knowledge

### Learning Objectives

1. To provide a foundation for further study in library and information science, including an appreciation for forms of systematic research in LIS.

2. To introduce central concepts, theories, principles, research issues, and people associated with the practice and study of information organization and access.

3. To advance a common set of ideas that help to define the profession's orientation toward problems of information organization and access.

## My Initial Impression/Thoughts

This class seems to be focused more on the information science side of LIS (whereas 502 will focus on the library science side of LIS), and thus will be pretty in line with my interests. I think it will provide a good theoretical and philosophical foundation to the more technical information science classes I will be taking, and may also dive into the history of information organization - which would be very interesting to me!

**Personal note:** I should go back and review the chapter/section about the origin of writing and libraries in "Sapiens" by Yuval Noah Harari. It would be interesting to compare his take to the readings and lectures from class.

The class will also likely provide an overview of some modern technologies or tools that we will use on the job to organize information. It seems that some of the Thursday lab classes are focused on a few of these.

Finally, I think there will probably be a bit of an ethics component - readings or discussions around issues like open access, privacy, duty to the public, etc. As librarians, we should always remember that our job is to help people by providing information or empowering them to access information on their own. Computers are merely the means, while people are both the beginning (creators of the accessed information) and the end (beneficiaries of the information). We are not gatekeepers, but guides.
