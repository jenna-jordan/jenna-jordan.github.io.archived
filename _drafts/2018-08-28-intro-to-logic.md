This lecture covered some basic terminology in logic and stressed that the meanings of words in English are not always equivalent to their meanings in logic. The concept of validity was also introduced.

## Basic Terms & Definitions

_Logic_ is the study of arguments:  
 * which statements follow from which,
 * and which arguments are good/bad and why

_Arguments_ (aka propositions) are:
 * groups of statements/claims
 * declarative sentences (not questions or suggestions)
 * either True OR False (not both, not neither)

Arguments can be sorted into 2 types of statements:
 * the premises (usually at least 2 in an argument)
 * the conclusion (usually 1 in an argument)

_Premises_ are:
 * the statements that bear the evidence & provide support
 * BUT, the premises might not actually support the conclusion
 * NOR might premises be true/correct

_Conclusions_ are:
 * the statement that is claimed to be supported by the premises
 * may be stated first or last in an argument (but usually last)
 * indicated in English by words/phrases like:
   - therefore, so, hence, consequently, entails, whence, thus, implies, whereby, as a result, if follows that, & we may infer

_Statements_ (premises & conclusions) are the basic units of logic
 * we only care about the statements' logical truth/possibility - it doesn't matter if the statement is biologically or physically impossible, only that it is logically possible
   - For example, "I can go faster than light" is logically possible. "I am both in Illinois and not in Illinois" is not logically possible.
 * logically necessary sentences are logical truths

Validity
 * If the conclusion of an argument follows from its premises, then the argument is said to be logically valid. (Otherwise, it's invalid)
 * Argument A is _valid_ if and only if:
	- It is logically necessary that if all the premies of A are true, then the conclusion of A is also true
	OR (these statements are equivalent)
	- it is logically impossible for both of the following to be true simultaneously: (1) all premises of A are true (2) conclusion of A is false

## Examples

__Argument A:__  
 * Premise 1: I am reading a book.  
 * Premise 2: If I am reading a book, then I am happy.  
 * Conclusion: I am happy.  

Argument A is valid.  

__Argument B:__  
 * Premise 1: I have blue eyes.  
 * Premise 2: Everyone who has blue eyes also has brown hair.  
 * Conclusion: I do not have brown hair.  

Argument B is not valid.  

__Argument C:__
 * Premise 1: Zebras have stripes.  
 * Premise 2: Lions eat zebras.  
 * Conclusion: Lions have manes.  

Argument C is not valid.
