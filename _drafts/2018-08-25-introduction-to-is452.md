### Course Description

> This course covers the common data and document processing constructs and programming concepts used in library and information science. The history, strengths and weaknesses of the techniques are evaluated in the context of our discipline. These constructs and techniques form the basis of applications in areas such as bibliographic records management, full text management and multimedia. No prior programming background is assumed. The first half of the course will focus on programming essentials in Python, and the second half will have us explore other applications and how to integrate the fundamentals to solve more complex problems.

  * Covers common data, document processing, and programming constructs and concepts.
  * Focuses on problem solving and abstraction with a programming language.
  * By the end of the course students will be able to design, develop and test a moderately complex computer program to manage full text, bibliographic records or multimedia.
  * The course prepares students for working with applications in data analytics, data science, digital libraries, text mining and knowledge management.
  * No prior programming background is assumed.

### Learning Objectives

1. To become familiar with programming essentials in Python

2. To be able to apply Python fundamentals to solve problems

3. To be able to design, develop and test a moderately complex computer program to manage full text, bibliographic records or multimedia

## My Initial Impression/Thoughts

This class seems like it will be a good introduction to Python... hopefully this time it will stick! I have previously taken an intro to python class at a local community college, but I didn't find it to be super engaging. I need challenges and projects that I am personally invested in, so my brain gets hooked into trying to make the code work.

I am curious to see how much the online aspect of this course contributes or detracts from my ability to learn the course content. I find it hard to stick with online classes and stay engaged (computers contain many distracting things), but I've also never had a synchronous online class where everyone is online and the class is happening live. It should definitely be a valuable experience to work with the teleconferencing software.

I'm also really intrigued by the fact that the professor hosts a Meetup at the local Makerspace for working on python projects, and that will be a really good resource for when I struggle on bigger projects (because I will struggle!).
