It's the start of my second semester at the UIUC iSchool, and I've got a whole new load of interesting classes that are going to keep my brain very busy. But before I introduce those classes, I want to reflect on what I learned last semester. I know, I know, the post really should have been written a month ago... but I was busy! And I've been very busy over break... relaxing, visiting family, driving (tons of driving), and hacking away at my IRDB project (no, it's still not finished). But enough with the excuses, it's time for some new-year-new-semester reflection.

As a quick reminder, last semester I took:
- IS501: Information Organization & Access
- IS452: Foundations of Information Processing
- IS490DB: Introduction to Databases
- PHIL103: Logic & Reasoning (audited)

## IS501: Information Organization & Access

This class was one of two required courses for the MSLIS program. It was a short class - only 10 weeks long - but a very jam-packed one: we met twice a week for 1.5 hours of lecture and 2 hours of lab. The class was essentially a survey of all the different component fields that together form the massive interdisciplinary professional field known as "library and information science". Seriously, there are so many different paths you can take within LIS that really are only tangentially related. Most of the students at my school are interested in paths like academic librarianship or archives, while I am interested in the digital and technical side of information science. So while only a few lectures in the class were of direct interest to me, it was definitely good to learn about all of the different options within LIS. Each class concluded with further courses within the iSchool that you could take if you were interested in that subject, as well as example job titles within that sub-field.
