### Course Description

> The course provides students with both theoretical and practical training in good database design. By the end of the course students will create a conceptual data model using entity-relationship diagrams, understand the importance of referential integrity and how to enforce data integrity constraints when creating a database. Students will be proficient in writing basic queries in the structured query language (SQL) and have a general understanding of relational database theory including normalization.

This course focuses on good database design and covers:
  * conceptual modeling
  * the relational model
  * the structured query language
  * normalization.

### Learning Objectives

1. Develop a general understanding of databases, and specific understanding of the relational database model.

2. Gain experience with both the theoretical and practical aspects of good database design

3. Develop proficiency with entity-relationship modeling

4. Develop proficiency in creating tables, primary and foreign keys and attribute constraints

5. Write working queries in the structure query language (sql)
Understand general concepts involved in database operation

## My Initial Impression/Thoughts

This class is a little bit intimidating... I'm worried about how much technical skill it assumes I will be starting with and how fast the course will progress. I'm also really interested in learning how to design databases, and I know that it will provide me with important technical skills going forward. I just hope the process of acquiring those skills isn't too painful!

I'm curious to see how well it will integrate with the python class. Will the information I learn in this class help with the python class, and vice versa? Will learning both sets of material enable me to produce more advanced projects? Will I be able to overlap the final assignments?

I'm also... apprehensive... about the textbook. It appears to be the only textbook/resource we will be using, and it has not received the best reviews online. Many people said they would only purchase it if they had to for the class, that it was highly theoretical/technical and hard to understand, and that it wasn't useful as a reference book. I will reserve judgement until I read it for myself, but I can't say I'm enthusiastic about it.
