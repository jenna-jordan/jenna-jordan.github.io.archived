This course is a basic introduction to formal logic - specifically propositional calculus. Zeroth-order logic (propositional calculus) is first order logic without variables/quantifiers, and zeroth order languages are both complete and compact. Sometimes propositional logic can include constants, operations, and relations on non-Boolean values.

## My Initial Impression/Thoughts

This class seems like a pretty basic intro to logic, and should be a lot of stuff that I've already seen before in less formal settings. Since I'm auditing the class, I'm really just taking this for my own entertainment/edification. Based on my initial impressions from the first class, there are going to be a lot of students taking this class so they don't have to take a (more difficult) math class, and that may push down the level of material the professor will be able to cover. Also coming to class olfactibly high on weed... that could also push the level of the class down ðŸ™„. Oh, undergrads...

So, we will see how the class goes. And if it turns out to be less useful than I'd hoped, at least auditing it is a pretty low-risk way to learn the material (no tests or assignments).
