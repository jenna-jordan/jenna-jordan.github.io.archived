### My personal blog

Welcome! This is my personal blog, a place for me to write, learn, and reflect. 
I will be writing here about such topics as library science, coding for libraries, databases, and more.

This blog uses the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme by mmistakes.
