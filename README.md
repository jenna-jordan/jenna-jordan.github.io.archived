Welcome! This is my personal blog, a place for me to write, learn, and reflect. 
I will be writing here about such topics as library science, coding for libraries, databases, and more.

This blog uses the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/about/), and was started with a fork from the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) repo.
