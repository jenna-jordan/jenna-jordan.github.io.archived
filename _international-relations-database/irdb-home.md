excerpt: "This project assembles together various projects that collect data on international relations (i.e. Correlates of War, ICOW, Polity IV) into one cohesive relational database. The GitHub repo contains the database schema, the original CSV files, and python scripts for transforming those CSV files into tables for the database."

Although I am going to school for Library and Information Science, the specific domain that I am interested in applying my digital information skills to is political science - in particular, international relations and conflict resolution. Many of the classes that I plan to take during my MSLIS conclude with open-ended final projects, in which you can apply the skills you have learned to the domain of your choice. My goal is to use these final projects to build a comprehensive and useful information tool for international relations scholars: an International Relations Database (IRDB).

During my first semester, I am taking a [class on databases](/blog/my-classes-for-fall-2018#is490db-introduction-to-databases)  and a [class on python](/blog/my-classes-for-fall-2018#is452-foundations-of-information-processing). Both classes conclude with a final project of our own devising. I have merged those two final projects into one: designing and creating the database itself, and then using python to load it with the appropriate data. For this first phase of the project, I am limiting myself to data from the [Correlates of War](http://www.correlatesofwar.org/) project. In the near future, I would like to expand it to also include data from the [Issue Correlates of War](http://www.paulhensel.org/icow.html) project, and the [Polity IV](http://www.systemicpeace.org/polityproject.html) project.

After completing the first phase of the IRDB, the Github project repo will contain the necessary scripts to allow anyone to create and fill the database on their own machine. I plan to incorporate proper attribution, metadata, and meaningful context drawn from the codebooks into the database, as well as include SQL scripts for example views that transform the complex database back into the tabular form political scientists are used to for analytical work.
