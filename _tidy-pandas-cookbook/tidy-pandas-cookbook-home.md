Please take a look at my poster for PyCon 2020, entitled "Python can be tidy too: pandas recipes for normalizing data".

The poster is also available at the [PyCon 2020 Online Poster Hall](https://us.pycon.org/2020/online/posters/)

The adorable Tidy Panda featured on the poster was created by Madelyn Ruck. See her other creations on her Instagram page, [@madruckus.design](https://www.instagram.com/madruckus.design/).
